# mindvalley_test
Technical assignment for mindvalley

Results
-------

1. The project is located in the `cv` subdirectory. Created script to convert JSON into standalone html file.
   You can see the conversation result of my own CV [here](http://uran198.github.io/mindvalley_test/).

2. Used minimax algorithm for 3x3 board and depth based minimax with heuristic score based on position
   for higher dimensions. The project is located in the `tic_tac_toe` subdirectory. The game only has CLI interface.

Statement
---------

1. Your resume/CV in JSON format and a parser for the resume so it can be displayed. We’d like you to submit your resume
   in JSON format, and have an app consume the JSON data and display it. It can be done on web, mobile, or any platform
   or language that you’re most familiar with. You can display it any way you think would be impressive: good
   typography, visualizations, etc. Don’t worry if your design is not as good as you’d like; **we’re mostly interested in
   how you parse the JSON you made** and the pretty rendering is just a bonus.

2. Write a tic-tac-toe app that never loses on a 3x3 board. The app will have a computer player and a human player. The
   computer player should always play the best move and never lose.  
   **Super bonus points** for being able to play on a 4x4 board and a 5x5 board (we will have a very interesting and
   fruitful interview if you do this). As before, you can do it on web, mobile, or any platform or language that you’re
   most familiar with.

3. If you’re applying for a middle or senior developer position (or you just want to do this challenge anyway): Write a
   URL shortener app. The app needs to be on the web and needs to use a database (any kind: relational, non-relational,
   file-based, etc). **Please don’t use online services like bitly or tinyurl**; that’s not the point of this exercise.
   When crafting your solution, take note of the following:
    - if the app becomes famous and you have 10,000 people trying to shorten urls every minute, what would the
      bottlenecks be?
    - how would you work around these bottlenecks?
    - how does the performance characteristics change when you have 500 million new links per month?

  Your URL shortener app needs to be able to address these challenges.
